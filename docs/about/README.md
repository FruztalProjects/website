## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is this server official?

The server staff are unpaid volunteers from the community. This is the largest, and one of the only Samsung servers listed on Discord’s Discovery list. We are not affiliated with Samsung or any other online communities except those listed in the affiliates channel.

### How do I report an issue?

Send a private message to @Mod Mail, found at the top of the members list. The message should include as much information as you can reasonably provide.

### Why can’t I post pictures or videos?

All users must send a certain amount of messages to be able to add attachments, this is an automatic system introduced to prevent trolls from posting NSFW content as soon as they join.
